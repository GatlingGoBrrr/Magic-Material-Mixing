(So this is Uncle Walt’s lab. It’s so dark and musty in here…)
(What does he even do in here? He’s mentioned his lab so many times, but he never actually tells me what he does in here.)
(Oh well, time to explore. I need to be quiet, or I might get caught. If Uncle Walt finds me here, who knows what’ll happen…)
(There’s a work station here! Let’s see what they have…)
(There are lots of chemicals here. Haroonium, Declanite, Joystone, and Valerian? WOW! The possibilities are endless with these.)
(Let's mix these and see what happens...)
