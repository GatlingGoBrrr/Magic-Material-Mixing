Jack: I see, I see… Why didn’t you open the air hole of the bunsen burner?
(I forgot to open the air hole.)
You: You see, the flame with an open air hole has different properties that lets you dehydrate the crystals better…
(No, it does not.)
Jack: Wow! You have amazing attention to detail. I have so much to learn from you! I look forward to working with you, other Jack! Haha!
You: Actually, about that…
Jack: Go team Jack!
You: Go... team… Jack…
(I'm leaving.)
