???: Good morning, Walt!
???: Wait… Are you another assistant here?
You: Yeah, I’m Jack, the new assistant.
??? Huh?
You: Are you an assistant too? What’s your name?
(Time to show off my acting skills!)
???: My name is Jack too! What a coincidence!
(Darn! This is the real assistant named Jack!)
You: Uhhh… yeah! Nice to meet you?
(Wait, this guy actually believed me? I guess I’ll play along.)
Jack: The selection interview for this position was so hard! I almost burned my hair off.
You: Yeah, me too.
(I’m a natural liar now!)
Jack: I can't wait to learn from you! Actually, can you show me how you managed to make crystallized Joylerian? 
Jack: How did you do it? I couldn't dehydrate my sample very well. What flame temperature did you use? 
Jack: What color was your crucible? How thick was your wire mesh?
You: Uhhh...
(What do I do? I should probably keep up this act. This guy is really gullible!)
You: Sure, I'll show you.
